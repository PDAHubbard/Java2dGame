Java2dGame
==========

This is a 2D game implemented in Java.

Harking back to my original game dev days, the graphics are implemented in ascii. Goal is for transitions, animations etc to be independant of the display so that different frontends can be made for different environments.

In this game you play the Good Capitalist, who must mine the BRC mountain for gold to turn into coins. You are hindered in your quest by the Evil Socialists, who make no attempt to mine gold but will try to steal your coins.

The only way to advance is to have enough coins to pay the Country Club bouncer so that you can recharge your batteries before heading back to the mountain.

The Evil Socialists will ignore you if you are carrying raw gold. If you are carrying coins, they will chase after you. You can only get rid of them by throwing coins at them, but be careful you still have enough to pay the bouncer!

The first thing you will do is customize the keys, unless you are a VIM user, as they are:

H     J     K   L
